# Recipe Management Application

This is a Spring Boot application that manages food recipes. Each recipe contains a list of tags and ingredients, along with a name and description. Users can register, log in, and manage their own recipes. The application uses MongoDB for data storage.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete recipes
- Search for recipes by tags or ingredients
- Recipe sharing between users (Still not sure about this feature)

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data MongoDB
- Spring Security
- Lombok
- Mockito for testing
- Docker and MongoDB
- Mongo Express for database management

### Note: This app is still in progress, once the backend is finsihed and tested properly, I will be moving onto the frontend.
